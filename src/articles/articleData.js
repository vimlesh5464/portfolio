INTRODUCTION

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
that enables computers to learn from data and improve automatically.

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?

Machine Learning is a technique where machines learn patterns
from data and make predictions.

Examples:
- Netflix recommendations
- Gmail spam detection
- Face recognition

--------------------------------------------------

TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING

1. SUPERVISED LEARNING
Uses labeled data.
Examples: House price prediction, Spam detection

2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
Uses unlabeled data.
Examples: Customer segmentation, Clustering

3. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
Learns using rewards and penalties.
Examples: Self-driving cars, Game AI

--------------------------------------------------

MACHINE LEARNING WORKFLOW

1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model training
4. Evaluation
5. Prediction

--------------------------------------------------

APPLICATIONS

- Healthcare
- Finance
