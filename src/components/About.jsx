        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          I'm <b>Vimlesh</b>, a passionate <b>MERN stack developer</b> from Mathura, India. I love building full-stack web applications that solve real-world problems and enhance user experience.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          I specialize in <b>MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js</b> — creating dynamic, high-performance web apps. My goal is to create clean, scalable, and maintainable code.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          I'm also a <b>DSA enthusiast</b> and consistently practice problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. My aim is to crack internships and roles at top product-based companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          I enjoy collaborating in teams, learning new technologies, and continuously improving my development workflow. I believe in writing code that’s not only functional but also elegant and well-documented.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg">
          When I’m not coding, I love exploring open-source projects, reading tech blogs, and helping others in the dev community.
